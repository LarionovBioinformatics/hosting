		Preprocessing

		Datasets were pre-processed using commonly accepted procedures, including background correction, normalisation, summation and log-transformation.  XPN batch correction was applied to merge Affymetrix and Illumina data in the Edinburgh L23 dataset (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909195" target="_blank">Turnbull et al 2012</a>).  Datasets were median-centered and scaled to a [-1 to 1] range.  For Edinburgh RS and L23 datasets the signatures were translated from Affy U-133 IDs into the namespace of the datasets.

		Iterative Consensus PAM
	</P>
    <P class = "MainTextLeft">
		The classification algorithm is illustrated on the figure below. It includes the following steps: <b>Step 1:</b> A pathway's signature is used to construct two pseudo-samples (centroids): one centroid corresponding to the active state of the pathway and the other centroid corresponding to the inactive state of pathway.  <b>Step 2:</b> The centroids are added to the datasets.  <b>Step 3:</b> The datasets are subjected to unsupervised partitioning using PAM (as implemented in Cluster R-package). Unsupervised PAM is repeated with incremental number of clusters until separate clusters are agglomerated around each of the centroids (or the centroids are allocated in different clusters). <b>Step 4:</b> The above procedure is repeated with three different distance metrics: Euclidian, Manhattan and Spearman correlation. Consensus between all three metrics is used for the final class allocations.
